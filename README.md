# Extra Attributes for Unity

Attributes for serialized fields in Unity.
It is indented to be used alongside other attirbute packages such as NaughtyAttributes.

## Attribute ideas
- `ScenePointAttribute` (Vector), `SceneDirectionAttribute` (Vector), `SceneRadiusAttribute` (float) draw a point, direction or sphere/circle in the scene for the given field. Make 2D/3D variants.
