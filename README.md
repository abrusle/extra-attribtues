# Extra Attributes for Unity

Attributes for serialized fields in Unity.
It is indented to be used alongside other attirbute packages such as NaughtyAttributes.

## Attribute ideas
- `ScenePoint` (Vector), `SceneDirection` (Vector), `SceneRadius` (float) draw a point, direction or sphere/circle in the scene for the given field. Make 2D/3D variants.
